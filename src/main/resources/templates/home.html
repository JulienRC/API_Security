		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This is the home page of our project called "API SECURITY".</p>

		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>The final objective is to have a double authentication to
			access to a specific page. In our case, it will be a page which
			contains every log of personal connection.</p>

		<h2>Technologies</h2>
		<p>For this project we are going to use different technology. The
			main technology will be Spring Boot which is a framework for Java,
			but it can also be use for Java EE which is our case.</p>
		<p>Spring Boot will use modules to easily create application. With
			the help of Maven, you just need to specify the package you need and
			Spring build the entire project.</p>
		<p>For the two authentication, we are going to use Google
			Authenticator and Twilo.</p>

		<h3>Google Authenticator</h3>
		<p>We will use the API of Google to authorize access to user or
			the creation of account. Once the user is connect with his Google
			account, he has access to the web site except for the page of logs.</p>

		<h3>Twilo</h3>
		<p>To access the log web site, the user will receive a code on his
			smartphone and he will have to enter this code on the website to
			access the log page.</p>
